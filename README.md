# PlantTools - Smart Agriculture Assistant

A comprehensive agriculture tool that provides intelligent recommendations for plant care, watering schedules, and crop selection based on environmental conditions and soil analysis. Available as a web application and iOS companion app.

## üåü Features

### 1. Watering Recommendations
- Calculates optimal watering schedules based on:
  - Soil type and composition
  - Local weather conditions
  - Plant-specific requirements
  - Container size and type
- Supports both pot and yard area calculations
- Generates detailed watering plans with frequency and amount recommendations

### 2. Crop Recommendations
- Provides crop suggestions based on:
  - Local climate data
  - Soil conditions
  - Temperature and humidity
  - Available growing space
- Supports both optimal and selective modes
- Includes detailed growing requirements for each crop

### 3. Plant Analysis
- Plant identification using PlantNet API
- Disease detection using YOLO and ResNet-34 models
- Growth stage classification
- Detailed plant health analysis
- Treatment recommendations for identified issues

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="your_key"
   export PLANTNET_API_KEY="your_key"
   export VISUAL_CROSSING_API_KEY="your_key"
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
